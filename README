# Craft wordpress import starter
This is a starter project for porting WordPress sites. It's a basic install that requires no database dump and no npm and only uses one first-party plugin (CKeditor) to keep things simple and maintailable as possible. It includes:

* A single for globals
* A home page single
* A blog single with articles channel and category structure
* A guestbook single with guestbook entries channel
* A pages structure for additional pages and subpages
* A Cloud-ready assets volume
* A basic template boilerplate in Twig to test with and act as a starting point to port to other front-ends

The Entries sidebar has also been configured to make these pages and sections easier to find for this setup.

While we strongly recommend DDEV for new Craft projects, alternate installation methods are available for anyone with a preexisting environment or preferred workflow that meets its requirements.

Install or update DDEV(opens new window), then follow these steps:

Create a project directory and move into it:

mkdir my-craft-project
cd my-craft-project/

Install dependencies:

ddev composer install

Start ddev:

ddev start

Run the Craft setup wizard, and accept all defaults (in [square brackets]):

ddev craft install

Our First-Time Setup(opens new window) guide in the Knowledge Base has more information about what to expect during setup.

Congratulations! You now have a fully-functional Craft application installed and configured. Run ddev launch to view the starter projectâ€™s welcome screen:
